# CFA - Project3 - StreetFoods

### A little about the project -
- This project was for us to speak to a client (preferably someone we don't know, unless we asked for permisson first). My client was my fiancee. I actually asked her if  I could build one of the projects she had designed and created herself. I thought it would be a great opportunity to challenge myself.

### Planning

After I got the okay to do this project I let my finacee know it could be built. She also warned me I might not be able to finish it in time and just do what I can. We had a few discussions about this before I started building StreetFoods.
