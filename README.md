# CFA - Project3 - StreetFoods

***Warning!***
* This project has been ejected.

### A little about the project -
This project was for us to speak to a client (preferably someone we don't know, unless we asked for permisson first) And make something for that client. My client was my fiancee. I actually asked her if  I could build one of the projects she had designed and created herself. I thought it would be a great opportunity to challenge myself.

The idea behind the StreetFoods Project is about food trucks that are tracked around Los Angeles. You open the web app on your phone or desktop and you can see where the trucks are located, you can then pick a truck and order your food and then go to the truck to pay and pick up your food without waiting in line.

### Planning

After I got the okay to do this project I let my finacee know it could be built. She also warned me I might not be able to finish it in time and just do what I can. We had a few discussions about this before I started building StreetFoods.

I used trello to pick out the features that were necessary for the core functionality of the project.
- Map
- Markers
- React Routes
- Email System to order food

### Personal Challenges, Enjoyment and Reflection.

- Implementing Google Maps API and making Maps render on the page.
- MobX was slightly difficult to implement, this was fun to learn about though as we didn't do this in class.
- Ejecting a project, I learned was a bad thing (in this case) to do.
- Navigation and React Routes was something esle I struggled to understand at first.
- @font-face I really struggled to understand due to docs/videos assuming knowledge.

###### Improvments I could make: (project and myself)
- Prioritise features. Work on one thing, make it look good before moving to the next thing.
- Seek assistance instead of struggling for too long. 
- Page route for menu list to menu items. Need to render the Menu Items where the Menu List is, instead of underneath.
- Page layout, Truck images and Text need to be side-by-side.
- Main logo needs to display over navbar and map.
