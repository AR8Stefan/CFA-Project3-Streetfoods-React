# CFA - Project3 - StreetFoods

***Warning!***
* This project has been ejected.

### A little about the project -
This project was for us to speak to a client (preferably someone we don't know, unless we asked for permisson first). My client was my fiancee. I actually asked her if  I could build one of the projects she had designed and created herself. I thought it would be a great opportunity to challenge myself.

### Planning

After I got the okay to do this project I let my finacee know it could be built. She also warned me I might not be able to finish it in time and just do what I can. We had a few discussions about this before I started building StreetFoods.

### Personal Challenges, Enjoyment and Reflection.

- Implementing Google Maps API and making Maps render on the page.
- MobX was slightly difficult to implement, this was fun to learn about though as we didn't do this in class. Ejecting, I learned was a bad thing (in this case) to do.
- Navigation and React Routes was something esle I struggled to understand at first.
- @font-face I really struggled to understand due to docs/videos assuming knowledge.

###### Improvments I could make: (project and myself)
- Prioritise features. Work on one thing, make it look good before moving to the next thing.
- Seek assistance instead of struggling for too long. 
- Page route for menu list to menu items. Need to render the Menu Items where the Menu List is, instead of underneath.
- Page layout, Truck images and Text need to be side-by-side.
- Main logo needs to display over navbar and map.
